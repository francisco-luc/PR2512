Title: How song attributes affects its popularity 

We have chosen a dataset that relates various objective and subjective features of different popular songs.

The dataset includes the following attributes: artist name, track name, popularity, danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, duration in milliseconds, and time signature.

From this, we can try to establish relationships between aspects such as the key or tempo of the songs and their popularity.

Another possible question to explore is adding the release year of each song (which is not included in the dataset) and analyzing how popularity over the years is influenced by different values. For example, we could investigate whether songs from the 1970s were less danceable than those from the 2000s or whether songs in a minor key were more popular in certain decades.

The dataset provides many general features, which gives us the flexibility to experiment with different variables and define an interesting premise to explore.
